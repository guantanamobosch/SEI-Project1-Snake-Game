Hi, and welcome to my Snake repo! 


As a casual gamer, I want to have a simple, aesthetic webpage where I can play one of my favorite classic games, Snake, and track my high score, so I can track my progress and even compete with my friends.

I want the snake to grow longer each time it grows an apple to have a sense of my progression in the game.

I want the snake to be unable to pass through itself, so that the appearance of the game doesn't become confusing and so that the challenge increases as the snake grows longer.

I want the snake hitting the walls to be a lose condition, and I would like there to be a message in the window letting me know that the snake has crashed and that the game is restarting.

I want the snake to move continuously upon each press of an arrow key, until either the snake is redirected or meets a lose condition.

I want to be able to adjust the speed of the snake.

*Some notes on Snake's History*

The first snake (or snake-like) game was designed by Lane Hauck, Ago Kiss, and Bob Pecarero, developed by Gremlin (before its acquisition by Sega in 1978), and released in 1976 as an arcade cabinet.
